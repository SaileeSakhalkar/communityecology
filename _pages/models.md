Find here the Shiny applications for all the models to be covered in class.

The underlying R functions and sample script are available on [SIS](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=MB120P85).

### Class 1: Population growth and regulation

1. [May's Equation](https://saileesakhalkar.shinyapps.io/MaysEquation/)

### Class 2: Communities as Dynamical Systems

1. [Lotka-Volterra Competition](https://saileesakhalkar.shinyapps.io/LV_Competition/)

### Class 3: Resource Competition

1. [Competition for one resource](https://saileesakhalkar.shinyapps.io/SingleResourceCompetition/)
2. [Competition for two resources](https://saileesakhalkar.shinyapps.io/TwoResources/)

### Class 4: Spatiotemporal variation in the environment

1. [Effect of disturbance on coexistence of two species](https://saileesakhalkar.shinyapps.io/disturbance/)
2. Effect of changing environmental conditions on species coexistence   
   1. [Environmental change switches the **carrying capacities** of two species](https://saileesakhalkar.shinyapps.io/envchange/)
   2. [Environmental change influences the **growth parameters** of two species](https://saileesakhalkar.shinyapps.io/Coexistence/)
